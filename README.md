# Card Generator

This is a web component that produces cards using the data provided. It is opinionated so it ignores properties that have the word `id` in it. It also looks for the following keywords and produces the output as mentioned:

- `img`, `image`, `icon`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.ico` -> produces an `<img>` element
- `url` -> produces an `<a>` element.
